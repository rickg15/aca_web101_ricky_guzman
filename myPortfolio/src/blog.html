        Class was extremely interesting today. One of the awesome things that I
        learned today was how to use VS Code to create an HTML page. This is
        what I am most excited about, learning to put together web pages!

        Today in class we learned how to give the computer commands using
        Terminal and how to upload files to GitHub. When creating a web page I
        think about what exactly I am trying to do with the page and from there
        what would my viewers like to get from my page.

        Today in class we heard from a guest speaker! In his presentation he
        talked about visitor traffic and the importance of this information. In
        his presentation he talked about something called a heat map. I was
        thinking something to do with temperature.

        Today in class I learned how to design a calculator. Key word was

        on in my spare coding time.
